Hi Hiring Manager,

Yeah, i checked out several urls in the list to find out if I could really do the task before applying.

I have checked the attached CSV file and found out that it is a list of 119,763 urls which you would like to extract the companies detail like their names, address, postal codes, email, etc.

The screenshot attached shows the information of one of the urls there in the list.
